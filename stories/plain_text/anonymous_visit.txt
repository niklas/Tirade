Story: Anonymous visitor clicks

  As an anonymous visitor
  I click through some public Pages
  So I can see their Contents

  Scenario: Visiting Main Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
    When visitor goes to /
      And visitor looks at Page
    Then he should see element: #header
      And he should see element: #footer
      And he should see element: a.login
      And he should see element: a.signup

  Scenario: Visiting Welcome Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
    When visitor goes to /welcome
      And visitor looks at Page
    Then he should see element: #header
      And he should see element: #footer
      And he should see element: a.login
      And he should see element: a.signup

  Scenario: Visiting non-existing Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
    When visitor goes to /meaning-of-life
      And visitor looks at Page
    Then he should see text: Page not found
      And he should see element: #header
      And he should see element: #footer
      And he should see element: a.login
      And he should see element: a.signup
      And he should not see link to new page

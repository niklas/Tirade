Story: Admin clicks

  As an User with Role 'admin'
  I click through some public Pages
  So I can see their Contents
    And edit their Renderings

  Scenario: Visiting Main Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
      And visitor logged in as quentin
      And visitor is admin
    When admin goes to /
      And admin looks at Page
    Then she should see element a.logout
      And she should see element body.role_admin
      And she should see element div.admin#admin_rendering_42101 a.edit.rendering
      And she should see element div.admin#admin_rendering_42102 a.edit.rendering
      And she should see link to edit rendering

  Scenario: Visiting a non-existing Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
      And visitor logged in as quentin
      And visitor is admin
    When admin goes to /meaning-of-life
      And admin looks at Page
    Then she should see text: Page not found
      And she should see element: #header
      And she should see element: #footer
      And she should see link to new page
    When she clicks on remote link to new page
    Then the Toolbox should open
      And she should see field page_url filled with 'meaning-of-life'
    When filling in page_title with 'The Meaning of Life"
      And submitting toolbox form new_page
    Then she should see text The Meaning of Life

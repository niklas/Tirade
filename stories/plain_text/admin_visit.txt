Story: Admin clicks

  As an User with Role 'admin'
  I click through some public Pages
  So I can see their Contents
  And edit their Renderings

  Scenario: Visiting Main Page
    Given a fresh open browser window
    And visitor logged in as quentin
    And visitor is admin
    When admin goes to /
    And admin looks at Page
    Then she should see element a.logout
    And she should see element body.role_admin
    And she should see element div.admin#admin_rendering_42101 a.edit.rendering
    And she should see element div.admin#admin_rendering_42102 a.edit.rendering
    And she should see link to edit rendering

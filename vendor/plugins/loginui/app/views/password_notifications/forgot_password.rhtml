Dear <%=@user%>,

Someone (hopefully you) has indicated that you cannot remember your password.
To let you reset your password we have provided a link below that will
automatically log you into the system and direct you to the "password reset"
page.

<%=@reset_link%>

It is suggested you reset your password as soon as possible since this is a
time-limited link (to protect your account).

If you did not request that your password be changed someone must have
entered your account in the "forgot password" page on our site. Your account is
still perfectly safe since you were the only person this message was sent to.
Simply delete this message and no changes will be made to your account if this
message was sent in error.

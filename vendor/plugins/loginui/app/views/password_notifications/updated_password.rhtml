Dear <%=@user%>,

Someone (hopefully you) has changed your password. This email is to notify
you of this change to help prevent against authorized access to your account.

If you did not change your password you will want to take further action to
ensure your account has not been comprimised. Your first step will be to
use the link below to assign your account a new password.

<%=@reset_link%>

Once you have done this please contact our organization so we can work with
you to ensure your account does not have any problems.

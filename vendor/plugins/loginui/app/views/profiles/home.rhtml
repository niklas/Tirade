<h1>Placeholder Home Page</h1>

<p>This page is simply a placeholder home page for users. If you are seeing
this page the developer forgot to do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Add a file under <code>app/views/profile/home.rhtml</code> that
	displays whatever you want in place of this.</li>
	<li>Implement the "home" action on the ProfileController to redirect wherever
	you want or provide application logic for your template file created in
	option one.</li>
</ol>

<%=link_to 'Logout', logout_url if current_user%>

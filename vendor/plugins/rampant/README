Rampant is a Ruby on Rails Plugin, spiced with Desert to make loosely Associtation between text containing Models.

Its a combination of:
* autotags (http://expressica.com/auto_tags/)
* machine_tags

So, if a Model.acts_as_rampant, its content will be analyzed before it is saved.
This analysis (from Yahoo) gives back some terms htat are relevant for this Model.
These are saved in our DB too.

Now, you can search, group, recommend or associate all the Models, independent of their Class etc.
So, if you have n different Models in your app, you won't need n*n join tables anymore.

JavascriptTestAutotest
======================

This is an extension to the Ruby on Rails Core Plugin javascript_test to provide a 'small change, run small test' script/command for javascript testing, similar to ZenTest's autotest command for Ruby testing.


Installation
============

This plugin requires the javascript_test plugin:

    ruby script/plugin install javascript_test
    ruby script/plugin install http://drnicutilities.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/javascript_test_autotest/

This will copy two files into your script/ folder:
    script/rstakeout
    script/js_autotest

Requirements
============

The current version requires Mac OS X and Safari.app. These are stupid requirements, since
the javascript_test plugin has a suite of browser helper classes to load HTML files into each
type of browser. If you get this plugin working on different O/S and browsers, please submit a patch to 
http://groups.google.com/group/drnicutilities

Usage
=====

From a command line:

    script/js_autotest
    
Now make a change to one of your test files (e.g. test/javascript/xxx_test.html), and it will be loaded 
automatically into your browser, and its tests executed.

Now, make a change to one of your javascript files (e.g. public/javascripts/xxx.js), and the corresponding xxx_test.html file will be opened into the browser and the tests executed.

Subversion
==========

This plugin is houses on Rubyforge.org via subversion:

    svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/drnicutilities/plugins/javascript_test_autotest

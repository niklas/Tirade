== Creating the test database

The test databases will be created from the info specified in
test/database.yml. Either change that file to match your database or
change your database to match that file.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. By default
sqlite will be the database run. Just change your env variable DB to be
the database adaptor (specified in database.yml) that you want to use.
The database and permissions must already be setup but the tables will
be created for you from schema.rb.

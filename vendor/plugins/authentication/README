= authentication plugin

This plugin provide the infrastructure for implementing a pluggable
authentication system. This plugin only provides support for the
lower-level model functionality to carry out various authentication
actions. Higher level functions that the user interacts with
(login pages, forgot my password, etc.) should be implemented by the
application or a plugin like the login plugin which is designed for
this purpose.

See the #Authentication module for overview info

= Installation

== Standard Method

    ruby ./script/plugin install http://authentication.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk
    mv vendor/plugins/trunk vendor/plugins/authentication

== Piston Method

    piston import http://authentication.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk vendor/plugins/authentication
    
= NOTICE

Since this plugin does not yet contain many modules that it hopes to
one day (POP3, etc.) the internal API is not set in stone. I wanted to
leave a place for plugging in other authentication systems but do not
yet actually have any need for any besides a salted hash and basic
tokens. This means as the others are added the internals will probably
change to account for the variety.

= NOTICE

Since nobody uses all aspects of this program different people are
maintaining different parts. If you have any questions about a specific
authentication module contact correct person:

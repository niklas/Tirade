module Authentication
  # Implements a basic salted hash authentication is the model's table.
  # The model must implement the fields "password_hash" and
  # "password_salt". If those fields are not implemented then this
  # module cannot authenticate the user. These fields should be a
  # string of 40 characters.
  #
  # NOTE: Some concepts here were borrowed from the Salted Login
  # Generator/Engine. I am not a security expert but this seems like it
  # would be quite safe and implements "best practice" methods for
  # authentication. I'm sure there are better ones but this is much
  # better than my old apps which used clear text passwords in the
  # databse. :)
  #
  # NOTE: There is a hidden feature here. If the model contains
  # the column "verified_at" then the user will not authenticate
  # until the verified_at column has a value. This is to support the
  # common practice of requiring a user to verify their email address
  # before being able to login. If the column is not defined then
  # the user can login as long as their password is correct.

module Authentication
  # Implements a token with expiration that is stored on the model
  # being authenticated. This is designed to implement the common
  # practice of having a token in the URL that will automatically
  # authenticate the user. 
  #
  # The model should implement the fields "token_key" (a 40 character
  # field) and "token_expiration" (a datetime field). If they are not
  # implemented this class cannot authenticate or assign tokens.
  #
  # This token module is called SingleToken because it only can
  # store one token. If another token is assigned the first is lost
  # and will not authenticate the user anymore. For common needs such
  # as forgot my password and account restoration this is fine.
  #
  # This token does NOT honor the verified_at field that the
  # Authentication::SaltedHash module and Authentication::RememberMe
  # module do since this token may be used to actually implement the
  # email verification.
